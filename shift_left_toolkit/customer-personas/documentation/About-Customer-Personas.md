### WHAT IS A USER(CUSTOMER) PERSONA?
A User Persona is a [Design Thinking](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/design-thinking/)  tool used to create a fictional representation of our ideal Internal or External Customer. Combined with other Design Thinking tools, a User Persona prompts us to deeply practice empathy towards our Internal and External Customers and how they engage with our applications and associated features.

### WHAT IS PERSONA BASED TESTING?
From the perspective of a [predefined User Persona](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html), a Team Member can navigate a specific feature of our app and from the viewpoint of the Internal or External Customer. The User Persona is meant to emulate what it would be like to use the application as an actual Internal or External Customer.

### PURPOSE/THE WHY?
In a development cycle, there are many opportunities for [Poka Yoke](https://kanbanzone.com/resources/lean/toyota-production-system/poka-yoke/) and discovering potential bugs far ahead of them reaching a production environment or even any environment following the initial creation of [eBikes_lue-Added](https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2016/volume-2/optimizing-software-development-with-lean-eBikes_lue-chain-analysis) work in the development phase. Discovery and adjustments brought about with Customer Persona testing are most empowering and impactful during the eBikes_lue-Added work and Quality Assurance performed during development. Without this initial assurance of functionality behaving as expected with the intended Customer Persona, any and every additional step from the end of development creates a multi-layered, contextual change-over as work moves further through the pipeline and into production. If a bug is discovered and, depending how soon it was discovered after the initial work, an original Team Member recommencing and getting properly set up to troubleshoot a bug or adjust functionality on a previously completed User Story can require a change-over change-over can include zero-to-several days of: working on a new/several User Story(ies), meetings, Team Member’s with full understanding or knowledge on the requirements or functionality not aeBikes_ilable to course-correct once bug discovered, troubleshooting a different bug, designing a new feature, another Team Member’s work being added on or refactoring of initial work performed, taking time for the 50% allocation to the other project we may be on, and/or time off from work. These are a few of the many scenarios that could take place during a Sprint and beyond.
