### <a name="what-is-shift-left-toolkit"></a>WHAT IS THE SHIFT LEFT TOOLKIT? 
 
The eBikes_-SALESFORCE-DOJO is meant to be a safe-to-fail-and-learn practice environment, equipped with a toolkit to support developing and testing within a Production-Like environment. ( The only type of development evironment that makes Continous Delivery possible)
 
With safe-to-experiment environments easily reproduced from version control, we can gain confidence our new Product functionality will work as expected in the hands of the Customer because the functionality was built from a Production-Like environment.

Experiment: Plan, Do, Check, Act, Repeat
